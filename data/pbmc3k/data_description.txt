3k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor
Single Cell Gene Expression Dataset by Cell Ranger 1.1.0

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor (same donor as pbmc6k).

PBMCs are primary cells with relatively small amounts of RNA (~1pg RNA/cell).

    2,700 cells detected
    Sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 with ~69,000 reads per cell
    98bp read1 (transcript), 8bp I5 sample barcode, 14bp I7 GemCode barcode and 10bp read2 (UMI)
    Analysis run with --cells=3000

Transcriptome: hg19
